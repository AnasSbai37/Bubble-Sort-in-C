String Bubble Sort

This repository contains a C program that demonstrates string sorting using the bubble sort algorithm. The program prompts the user to enter a number of strings, performs the sorting using strcmp and strcpy functions, and displays the sorted strings.

Features:

Bubble Sort Algorithm: The program uses the classic bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of strings.
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Strings are dynamically allocated based on user input, allowing flexibility in the number of strings to be sorted.
Error Handling: The program checks if the number of strings exceeds the maximum allowed size and provides appropriate error handling.
Usage:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/AnasSbai37/Bubble-Sort-in-C
Compile the program: gcc BubbleSort.c -o BubbleSort
Run the executable: ./BubbleSort
